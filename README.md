React Web Weather App (Not Finished Yet, Coming Soon)
==
This project is a web weather app that features current weather and hourly forecasting including the temperature, weather status, and air conditions. This web uses React JS with forecast data from GeoAPI and OpenWeatherAPI.

*To use it, please create a new file as "config.js" and put your API key from GeoAPI and OpenWeatherAPI in the file to be imported as data references.*
